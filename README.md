# TensorTonic ML Solutions 🧠

This repository contains my personal solutions to the machine learning coding challenges on [TensorTonic](https://www.tensortonic.com/). The goal of these problems is to implement foundational ML algorithms from scratch—primarily using NumPy—to deeply understand the mathematics behind AI.

## 🚀 Overview
Rather than using high-level libraries like Scikit-Learn or PyTorch, these solutions focus on "under-the-hood" implementations of:
* **Optimizers:** Adam, SGD, Momentum, RMSprop.
* **Deep Learning:** Forward/backward passes, Batch Norm, Dropout.
* **Math & Stats:** Cross-Entropy Loss, Softmax, Information Gain.
* **Classic ML:** Linear/Logistic Regression, K-Means, Decision Trees.
